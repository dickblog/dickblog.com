<P>I'm looking at getting a DVD recorder and like the look of the new <A class="" href="http://www.panasonic.co.uk/products/home-entertainment/dvd/recorder/dmre100hebs/dmre100hebs.htm" target=_blank>Panasonic DMRE100HRBS</A> which records DVD-R, DVD-RAM and has a 80Gb hard disk.</P>
<P>In my search for more product information I've found this great forum at <A class="" href="http://thewholewideweb.com/forum/default.asp?CAT_ID=7" target=_blank>The Whole Wide Web</A> which has been most useful!</P>
