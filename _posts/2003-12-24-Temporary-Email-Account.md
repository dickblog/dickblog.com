<P>We've all been onto websites that require you to give an email address before you can download their demo software. I guess that I'm not alone in being twitchy about giving out my regular address to unknown people. Gosh knows I get enough spam as it is!</P>
<P>Well there's this great website, <A class="" href="http://www.mailinator.com/" target=_blank>Mailinator</A>, where you can get a temporary email address that'll last as long as is required to get that acknowledgement email from that website.</P>
