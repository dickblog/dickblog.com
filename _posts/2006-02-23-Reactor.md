I'm really keen to get into some of these things like <a href="http://coldspringframework.org/" target="_blank">ColdSpring</a> and <a href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm?filter=category&amp;categoryId=30" target="_blank">Reactor</a>. Brian Rinaldi has <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/2/17/Getting-Started-with-Reactor" target="_blank">blogged an intro to Reactor </a>which is worth reading.<br/>
