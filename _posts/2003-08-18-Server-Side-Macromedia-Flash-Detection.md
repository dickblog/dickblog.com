<P>From Macromedia's site, here's the <A class="" href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/articles/browser_hawk.html" target=_blank>latest thinking</A> on detecting if the browser has Flash installed.</P>
<P>"As of April 2003, there are over 522 million users with Macromedia Flash Player, comprising 98% of all web users. Even so, there are still some users who don't have Macromedia Flash Player installed and others who don't have the latest installation of it. Since its release in April of 1998, BrowserHawk (produced by cyScape) has been the favorite server-side tool used by developers to accurately detect Macromedia Flash. Macromedia Flash Detection Kit is the preferred method for client-side Flash detection. In this article, I'll touch on various methods of performing Flash detection and then take a detailed look at using BrowserHawk to detect Macromedia Flash in ASP, C#, ColdFusion MX, and JSP/Servlet environments".</P>
