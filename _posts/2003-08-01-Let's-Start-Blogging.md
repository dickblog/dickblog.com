<P>Okay, it's the first of the month, so it sounds like a good time to start my wander into blogging. </P>
<P>I don't know if I'm like most people that start blogging, but I think this is something I'm going to have to think about. What do I post up? Yes I know it's a good place to drop notes to yourself and share your knowledge and findings as you wander the web, but what about personl experiences? </P>
<P>How much about your work do you share? Don't want to get the sack! And your personal life? </P>
<P>Time will tell :-)</P>
