The <a href="http://www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html" target="_blank">Colour Contrast Check</a>
is a very simple web-based tool that allows you to specify a foreground
and a background colour and determine if they provide enough of a
contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits. A great tool to
add to your accessibility toolbox.
