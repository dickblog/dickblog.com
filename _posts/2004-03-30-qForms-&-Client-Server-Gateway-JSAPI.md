<P>Here's an interesting JavaScript form API.</P>

<P>Also on this site is an useful Client/Server Gateway JSAPI. With it you can call data from your app and display it on the page without a refresh. A much better UI.</P>

<P>I especially like the n-Related Select Box Demo. Very useful. Now all I need is reason to use it! :-)</P>
