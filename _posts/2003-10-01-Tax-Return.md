<P>Actually got my Tax Return completed last night. Just in time! I <A class="" href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/" target=_blank>did it online</A> again this year and it's not so bad. It guides you through all the step quite well. </P>
<P>The only prob I'm having is printing the Acrobat file it produces. There seems to be some corruption in the display part of the file. I'll have to do some more investigation.</P>
<P>Anyway, the long and the short of it is that I've been a good boy and saved more than I needed to, so we might have enough to go sking this year as a family for the first time!</P>
<P>Here's hoping!</P>
