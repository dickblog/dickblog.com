From Steve Erat's blog...<br/><br/>&quot;Here's a <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=alias&amp;alias=RestartCFMX" target="_blank">UDF </a>I came up with to restart ColdFusion MX from your code.
Say you needed a way to restart, but you're not on the server or can't
get a remote desktop on the server, or perhaps you're monitoring
getMetricData and you have a criterion for which you might wish to
restart CFMX.&quot;
