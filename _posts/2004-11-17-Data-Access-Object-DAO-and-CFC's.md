<P>Joe Rinehart&nbsp;has a good review of <A class="" href="http://clearsoftware.net/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=3D1115E7-E081-2BAC-6953DA4394855DDB" target=_blank>DAO principles</A>.</P>
<P>"A Data Access Object (DAO) is an object that, well, accesses data. More formally, it abstracts interaction with a persistance layer (a database, flat file, etc.) for a single object. In basic terms: it creates a new row, reads a row, updates a row, or deletes a row. These four actions are often abbreviated as CRUD. Cute, no?".</P>
