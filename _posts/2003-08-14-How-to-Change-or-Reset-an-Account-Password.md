<P><A class="" href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106156" target=_blank>Resetting the original Admin account password</A>.</P>
<P>Follow these steps to reset a password when there is only one Admin account on the computer, or if the original Admin account (of several) needs a password reset. "Original" Admin account refers to the one that was created immediately after installing Mac OS X. So long as the original Admin password is known, the original Admin user may reset the passwords of other Admin accounts using the steps described above. </P>
