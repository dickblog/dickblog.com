<P>I've always had an unheathly interest in internet virues, hoaxes and scams. If you know something about computers others always seems to forward on "friendly" warnings and "advice" on the latest "alert"! </P>
<P>As most of these are scams in themselves I thought I start recording them for the interest of others.</P>
<P>The basic advice is that. </P>

<LI>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. <BR></LI>
<LI>Rather than forward any "friendly" warnings onto everyone in your address book, look up the "advice" any of the websites below or ask sommone in the know. If you know me, ask me.<BR></LI>
<LI>Use the delete button on your email client.<BR></LI>
<LI>Don't open attachments in emails from those you don't know.<BR></LI>
<LI>Don't open attachments ending in .scr or .pif or .exe even from people you know.</LI></UL>
