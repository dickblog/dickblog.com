As I blogged before, I've recently completed a Java course which exposed me to OOP for the first time. So now I'm beginning to think that I should get up to speed with Mach-II.<br/><br/>So when I found this on Sean blog I though I'd better record it for later.<br/><br/>&quot;Trond has written a nice, gentle <a href="http://tutorial345.easycfm.com/" target="_blank">introduction to Mach II</a> which is published on EasyCFM.&quot;
