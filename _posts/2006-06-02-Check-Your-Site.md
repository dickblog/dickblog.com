<a href="http://www.scrutinizer.phileplanet.com/" target="_blank">The Scrutinizer</a> is an interesting site. It allows you to analyze your site against validators, Accessibility, Alternate Access, site access and load times, Browser Compatibility etc etc.

From the site:"Rather than creating direct links to various validators and link analyzers, one link can be used to submit to all of them. It simplifies the task of figuring out which application needs what type of URL (Domains only/HTTP/No HTTP) and also saves time and space by freeing up the code from unneccessary URLs."
