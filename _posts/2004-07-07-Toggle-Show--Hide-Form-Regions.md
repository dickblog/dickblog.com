<P>This idea is titled "<A class="" href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/trimming_form_fields.html" target=_blank>Trimming form fields</A>" which got me interested from the point of trimming data entry on forms before inserting the data into a database. But it doesn't.</P>
<P>What it does do is toggle on and off regions of a form which I'm trying to do with a tabbed interface. Let's see if it works!</P>
