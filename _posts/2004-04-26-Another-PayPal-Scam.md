<P>Got the following&nbsp;email today</P>
<P>This is the first time I've had this one. I like the ColdFusion quote. That got me interested for a while! After having a quick Google I've found that&nbsp;this scam seems quite popular, but with different companies named, like:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Carex Pharmaceuticals Corporation </LI>
<LI>Insta-Pro&nbsp;International&nbsp;Corporation</LI></UL>
