Where have I been going wrong! <br/><br/>It seems from <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?do=blog.entry&entry=D1CB9656-0284-4F53-209C8F9F6159FB8D" target="_blank">Sean's blog</a> that I, and most dev's, have got hold of the wrong end of the stick when it comes to Hungarian Notation.<br/><br/>Sean quotes <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html" target="_blank">Joel's blog</a> and he, eventually, makes some interesting points.<br/><br/>Personally I'm happy with prefixing vars with their datatype as I think it's appropriate for a weakly type language like ColdFusion. Plus it helps with db column types when it comes to choosing the cfsqltype attribute.<br/><br/>Other links from Joel:<br/><ul><li>Dr. Charles  Simonyi's original paper, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs600/html/hunganotat.asp">Hungarian Notation</a></li><li>Doug Klunder <a href="http://www.byteshift.de/msg/hungarian-notation-doug-klunder">introduced this to the Excel team</a> in a somewhat clearer paper</li></ul>

[Update: 25-June 2006] Actually it seems like I wasn't so wrong. Sounds like I've been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" target="_blank">Hungarian System Notation</a> according to Wikipedia.
