<p>Ben Nadel&nbsp; has <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:1118.view" target="_blank">blogged</a> a neat way to render a &quot;Down For Maintenance&quot; page including being Google friendly. The only thing I'd change is to put the code outside of the Application.cfc in a CFINCLUDE so that it could be styled to suit the site without all that code cluttering up the Application.cfc file.</p>
