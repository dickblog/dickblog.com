Hal Helms, noted ColdFusion author and trainer, has an excellent newsletter that I highly recommend. The <a href="http://www.halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.show&issue=011405_context" target="_blank">most recent newsletter</a> (actually the last few) have been extremely interesting to those who are just beginning to enter into the object oriented world. Hal does an excellent job at taking confusing, sometimes seemingly contradictory concepts and explaining them in a way that is easily understandable.
