<P>Went to see the file <A class="" href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/underworld/" target=_blank>Underworld</A> today.</P>
<P>What a disappointment!</P>
<P>The soundtrack was poor. It sounded like most of it had been re-recorded on a telephone box afterward.</P>
<P>It was trying to be stylish, like a Ridley or&nbsp;Tony&nbsp;Scott film, but failed to impress. Even Kate Beckinsale clad in either a black leather or rubber catsuit was a disappointment. Her cultured english voice seemed so out of place in this mismash of US/Eastern European images.</P>
<P>The storyline was really confusing was well. One minute the vampires were the goodies and the Lycans (as in Lycanthropes&nbsp; - I didn't know that was another name for werewolves) were the baddies! The next it was the other way around. Very confusing. You ended up trying to work it out in your mind rather than watching the film!</P>
