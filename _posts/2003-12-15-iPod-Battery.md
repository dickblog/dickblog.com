<P>Having recently upgraded my second generation 10GB&nbsp;iPod to a new slimline 20GB model, I've started to read scare stories about the life of the battery, so I started this new blog theme.</P>
<P>The <A class="" href="http://www.ipodsdirtysecret.com/" target=_blank>iPod's Dirty Secret</A> was the first website to get the story out.</P>
<P>Then Apple <A class="" href="http://www.info.apple.com/support/applecare_products/service/ipod_service.html" target=_blank>extended AppleCare</A> to cover battery replacement. [23 Dec 03 - Correction, it seem like Apple had this covered all the time, according to this <A class="" href="http://www.macnn.com/news/22054" target=_blank>MaCNN article</A>]</P>
<P>Other advice on battery replacement can be found at this <A class="" href="http://das.doit.wisc.edu/ipodbatteryfaq/" target=_blank>website</A>.</P>
<P>I've also found the <A class="" href="http://www.ipodbattery.com/slimipodinstall.htm" target=_blank>Laptops of Less</A> US website for replacement batteries which also talks about&nbsp;the <A class="" href="http://www.pda-store.co.uk/" target=_blank>PDA Store</A>&nbsp;to get the battery in the UK.</P>
