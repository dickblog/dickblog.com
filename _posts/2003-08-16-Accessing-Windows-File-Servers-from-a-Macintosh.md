<P>This article from the Macromedia website talks about integrating Mac's with Windows and Dreamweaver.</P>
<P>"Few company networks have only one type of operating system connected, It is not uncommon for web developers to use Macintosh computers for site development, and web servers running some version of Microsoft Windows Server with Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or some other database servers the back-end database. This complex set of operating systems and environments can present headaches when communicating and transferring data between these platforms. In <A class="" href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/dreamweaver/articles/accessing_win.html" target=_blank>this article</A>, I explore the integration of Apple Macintosh computers running both Mac OS X 10.2 and Mac OS 9 into a heterogeneous network and I demonstrate how to create a site definition that connects to IIS (Internet Information Server) on a Windows 2000 Server".</P></DIV>
