<p>I've just treated myself to a new car. A Mazda MX-5 1.8 Euphonic.</p>
<p>Here's a review I've found:</p>
<p>&quot;Mazda has launched a new special edition for 2004, the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic, equipped with a premium Sony audio system featuring MP3 compatible CD player, six-disc CD auto-changer and six Sony high clarity speakers. In Mazda showrooms now, the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic is priced from &pound;16,500 on the road for the 1.6i model and &pound;17,000 on the road for the 1.8i model.</p>
<p>The Euphonic adds extremely high levels of specification to the standard Mazda MX-5 featuring a chrome interior look designed to complement the premium Sony audio system. Two-tone heated leather seats, unique 16-inch alloy wheels, black cloth soft top and windblocker, are just some of the great value for money features on this special edition.</p>
<p>The Mazda MX-5 Euphonic takes cues from the successful Mazda RX-8 sports coupe with its black and red seats, black leather steering wheel, gear knob and handbrake lever with red stitching, red door inserts and stainless steel scuff plates. The Mazda MX-5 Euphonic is available in Velocity Red Mica, Titanium Grey Metallic, Brilliant Black and Sunlight Silver Metallic.</p>
<p>All the usual safety and convenience features are fitted as standard to the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic, including anti-lock brakes, Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), seats with integral head restraints and remote central door locking. A Limited Slip Differential is also standard on the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic 1.8i.</p>
<p>The Mazda MX-5 Euphonic Special Edition is set to be a much sought after vehicle. Just 2,000 will be available in the UK until mid 2004, with a choice of the lively 1.6-litre 110ps engine or the spirited 1.8-litre, 146ps engine.</p>
<p>Recently named Britain&rsquo;s Best Handling Car 2003 by Autocar, the rear-wheel drive Mazda MX-5 powered by either the 1.6i or 1.8i engine boasts dynamic driving performance for that pure sports car &lsquo;fun-to-drive&rsquo; feel, and guarantees peace of mind thaaks to high levels of safety and reliability. With highly responsive steering, agile handling and a firm ride, the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic reminds you what true sports car driving is all about.</p>
<p>The 1.6-litre model has a top speed of 119mph, accelerates to 62mph in 9.7 seconds and returns 36.7mpg on the combined cycle. Powered by the 1.8-litre engine the Mazda MX-5 has a top speed of 127mph, reaches 62mph in just 8.5 seconds and returns 32.5mpg on the combined cycle.</p>
<p>The insurance group for the Mazda MX-5 Euphonic remains unchanged with the 1.6i at 11E and the 1.8i at 12A.</p>
<p>Over 56,756 Mazda MX-5s have been sold in the UK since launch, while 2003 was an all-time record year for the Mazda MX-5 in the UK with sales exceeding 9,000, an increase of 24.4 per cent over 2002.</p>
<p>The Mazda MX-5 Euphonic is available in showrooms now priced from &pound;16,500-&pound;17,000 on the road.&quot;</p>
