<p>A Husband takes his wife to play her first game of golf. Of course, the
wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the
biggest house adjacent to the course.<br/>
The husband cringed, &quot;I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go
up there, find the owner, apologize, and see how much your lousy drive
is going to cost us.&quot;<br/>  So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, &quot;Come on in.&quot;<br/>
When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was
all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side
near the broken window.<br/>  A large man reclining on the couch asked, &quot;Are you the people that broke my window?&quot;<br/>  &quot;Uh..yeah, sir. We're sure sorry about that,&quot; the husband replied.<br/>
&quot;Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you. You see,
I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years.
Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll
give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one
for myself.&quot;<br/> </p> &quot;Wow, that's great!&quot; the husband said. He
pondered a moment and blurted out, &quot;I'd like a million dollars a year
for the rest of my life.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No problem,&quot; said the genie. &quot;You've got it, it's the least I can do.
And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life! And now you, young lady,
what do you want?&quot; the genie asked.<br/>  &quot;I'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world,&quot; she said.<br/>  &quot;Consider it done,&quot; the genie said. &quot;And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now,&quot; the couple asked in unison, &quot;What's your wish, genie?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a
woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your
wife.&quot;<br/> The husband looked at his wife and said, &quot;Gee, honey, you
know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you
think?&quot;<br/> She mulled it over for a few moments and said, &quot;You know,
you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind,
but what about you, honey?&quot; You know I love you sweetheart,&quot; said the
husband. &quot;I'd do the same for you!&quot;<br/><br/>So the genie and the woman went
upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each
other. The genie was insatiable.<br/><br/>After about three hours of
non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes
and asked, &quot;How old are you and your husband?&quot;<br/>  &quot;Why, we're both 35,&quot; she responded breathlessly.<br/>  &quot;No Kidding.&quot; he said, <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  &quot;Thirty-five years old and both of you still believe in genies?&quot;
