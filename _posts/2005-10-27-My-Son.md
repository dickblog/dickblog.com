A bloke is in a queue at the Supermarket when he notices that the
rather dishy blonde behind him has just raised her hand and smiled a
hello to him. <p>
He is rather taken aback that such a looker would be waving to him and
although familiar he can't place where he might know her from, so he
says, &quot;sorry but do you know me?&quot; She replies &quot;I may be mistaken, but I
thought you might be the father of one of my children.&quot; </p><p>
His mind shoots back to the one and only time he has ever been
unfaithful, &quot;Christ!&quot; he says &quot;are you that stripogram on my stag night
that I sh*gged on the snooker table in front of all my mates whilst
your mate whipped me with some wet celery and stuck a cucumber up my
a*se!?&quot; </p><p>
&quot;No&quot; she replies coldly,&quot;I'm your son's English Teacher&quot;. </p>
