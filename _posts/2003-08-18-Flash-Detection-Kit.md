<P>What happens when a user encounters your Macromedia Flash content with an old or outdated version of Macromedia Flash? What does a user see in an older web browser that doesn't support plug-in detection? Do you know what will happen if users visit your site with Internet Explorer Macintosh version 4.5? Have you ever had a client call you up in a panic when he can't see the content you just spent two months developing together?</P>
