<P><STRONG>Vulnerability</STRONG> </P>
<P>There is a flaw in the way that Internet Explorer displays URLs in the address bar. By opening a specially crafted URL an attacker can open a page that appears to be from a different domain from the current location. </P>
<P><STRONG>Exploit</STRONG> </P>
<P>By opening a window using the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com@www.dickblog.com/">http://www.microsoft.com@www.dickblog.com/</A> nomenclature an attacker can hide the real location of the page by including a 0x01 character before the "@" character. Internet Explorer doesn't display the rest of the URL making the page appear to be at a different domain. </P>
<P>So this link may look good, but it's bad.</P>
