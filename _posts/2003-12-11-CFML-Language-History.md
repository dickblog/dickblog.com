<P>Alway wanted to know the history of the CFML language? Well <A class="" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/ts/documents/cfmlhistory.htm" target=_blank>here it is</A>. Download the zip file and you'll have some HTML pages which chart the version of CF and when commands and function were added, attribute changes, deprecated and made obsolete. </P>
<P>If I get around to it I'll load these pages onto this site and put a link here so you won't have to download it yourself.</P>
