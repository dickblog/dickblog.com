&quot;<a href="http://www.aquafold.com/" target="_blank">Aqua Data Studio</a> is a database query tool
              and administration tool that allows developers to easily create,
              edit, and execute SQL scripts, as well as browse and visually modify
              database structures. Aqua Data Studio provides an integrated database
              environment with a single consistent interface to all major relational
              databases. This allows the database administrator or developer
              to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously from one application.&quot;
