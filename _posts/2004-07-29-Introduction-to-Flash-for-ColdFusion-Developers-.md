<P>"I delivered a presentation today to ColdFusion User Group managers via Breeze. It's basically an introduction to Flash and RIAs for ColdFusion developers. I go through some slides discussing RIAs in general, then dissect a Flash and ColdFusion application line by line. It's about an hour long, so if you have some time, and you're curious about Flash and RIAs, <A class="" href="http://macromedia.breezecentral.com/p25805782/" target=_blank>check it out</A>."</P>
