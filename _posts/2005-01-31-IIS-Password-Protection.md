&quot;IIS password protection of files and folders has always been dificult.
<a href="http://www.troxo.com/products/iispassword/" target="_blank"><b>IISPassword</b> </a>brings the ease and power of Apache&rsquo;s htaccess to Microsoft IIS. No longer is there a need for system
user accounts and complex access permissions for maintaining a secure, password protected web site.

<p class="standardtext">
IISPassword uses Basic HTTP Authentication for password protecting web sites on IIS, just like htaccess works on
Apache. That makes your password protected Apache web site compatible with IIS, and vice versa.

<p class="standardtext">
A powerful and intuitive interface makes it possible to password protect a web site in just moments. More advanced
settings provide options such as user group management and protection of certain file types.&quot;</p>
