<P>"This document provides guidelines for developing ColdFusion MX applications within Macromedia's Web Technology Group. The rules and guidelines given here are intended to apply to CFMX 6.1 specifically and may not be appropriate for earlier versions (including CFMX 6.0). It is a living document, growing over time, incorporating feedback from Web Technology Group developers and, sometimes, the larger ColdFusion community, as the guidelines are 'proved' in our live environment."</P>
