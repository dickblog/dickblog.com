<P>Here's very cool trick&nbsp;picked up from&nbsp;up from <A href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;f=8300945231&amp;m=682005276631">Ars Technica</A>. Basically, inside of any Cocoa application, you can hit F5 or Option-Esc to get a list of spelling suggestions. How cool is that? Totally undocumented, and totally useful.</P>
