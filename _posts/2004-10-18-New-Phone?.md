<p>Thinking about getting a new phone, but I want to make it a bit smarter than my current Nokia 3210. So I'm looking at Bluetooth to sync up with my Mac and app's that'll take my Entourage contacts/calendar onto the phone.</p><p>First solution... <a class="" href="http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/MobileSync/" target="_blank">MobileSync</a> that will take my Entourage contacts/calendar and sync it with a range of Sony Ericsson phones.</p><p>Of course I need to check out the offerings from&nbsp;<a class="" href="http://www.pocketmac.net/" target="_blank">PocketMac</a>.</p><p>And I've just found <a class="" href="http://www.markspace.com/products.html" target="_blank">The Missing Sync</a>&nbsp;as well as <a href="http://www.macmedia.sk/pa.htm" target="_blank">Phone Agent</a> which looks the best bet.</p>
