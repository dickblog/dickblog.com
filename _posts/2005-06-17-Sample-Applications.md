Looking for example applications built with Macromedia products? I found <a title="Macromedia Sample Applications" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/topics/sample_apps.html" target="_blank">this list of Macromedia sample applications</a> 
in the del.icio.us side bar on <a title="ColdFusion Portal" href="http://cfmx.org/" target="_blank">cfmx.org</a>.

<p>There are Flex, Flash, ColdFusion, and Dreamweaver example apps there.</p>
