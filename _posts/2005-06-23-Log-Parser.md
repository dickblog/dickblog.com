&quot;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/tools/logparser/default.mspx" target="_blank">Log Parser</a> is a powerful, versatile tool that provides universal query access to 
text-based data such as log files, XML files and CSV files, as well as key data 
sources on the Windows&reg; operating system such as the Event Log, the Registry, 
the file system, and Active Directory&reg;.&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell Log Parser what information 
you need and how you want it processed. The results of your query can be 
custom-formatted in text based output, or they can be persisted to more 
specialty targets like SQL, SYSLOG, or a chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most software is designed to 
accomplish a limited number of specific tasks. Log Parser is different... the 
number of ways it can be used is limited only by the needs and imagination of 
the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is your database with Log Parser.&quot;
