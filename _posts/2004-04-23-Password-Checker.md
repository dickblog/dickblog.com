<P>Found this cool UDF on the <A class="" href="http://www.cflib.org/udf.cfm?id=1072" target=_blank>cflib.org</A> website. </P>
<P>It will server-side check the submitted password.</P>
<P>"This function will check the complexity of a password. It will check for the existence of letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters in a given password. Optionally, it can for check for the number of times each of these occurs."</P>
<P>Now all I need is the same functionality in JavaScript client-side!</P>
