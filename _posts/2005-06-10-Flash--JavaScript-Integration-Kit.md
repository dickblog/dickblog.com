	<p><a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/flash_js_integr.cfm" target="_blank">Christian Cantrell</a>'s latest piece of work was co-developed by  Mike Chambers.  The <a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/flashjavascript/">Flash / JavaScript Integration Kit</a>
is a freely downloadable package that lets you seamlessly communicate
between Flash and JavaScript. You can call JavaScript functions from
Flash, and visa-versa. From their product page they state that:</p>

	<p>While
there have been ways to communicate between JavaScript and Flash in the
past, they have not worked reliably across browsers and/or platforms.
Furthermore, these techniques only allow you to pass strings between
JavaScript and Flash, and not complex data types such as objects and
arrays.</p>
