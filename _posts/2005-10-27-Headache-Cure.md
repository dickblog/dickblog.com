<p>The doctor said, &quot;Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.
The bad new is that it will require castration. You have a very rare
condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and
thepressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the
pressure is to remove the testicles.&quot;</p>  <p>Joe was shocked and
depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice
but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a
headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was
missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he
realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new
beginning and live a new life. He saw a men's clothing store and
thought, &quot;That's what I need... a new suit.&quot; He entered the shop and
told the salesman, &quot;I'd like a new suit.&quot;</p> <p>
		
		</p><p>The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, &quot;Let's see... size 44 long.&quot;</p>  <p>Joe laughed, &quot;That's right, how did you know?&quot;</p>  <p>&quot;Been in the business 60 years!&quot; the tailor said.</p>  <p>Joe tried on the suit.. it fit perfectly.</p>  <p>As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, &quot;How about a new shirt?&quot;</p>  <p>Joe thought for a moment and then said, &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>  <p>The salesman eyed Joe and said, &quot;Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.&quot;</p>  <p>Joe was surprised, &quot;That's right, how did you know?&quot;</p>  <p>The salesman said, &quot;Been in the business 60 years.&quot;</p>  <p>Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly.</p>  <p>Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, &quot;How about some new underwear?&quot;</p>  <p>Joe thought for a moment and said, &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>  <p>The salesman said, &quot;Let's see... size 36.&quot;</p>  <p>Joe laughed, &quot;Ah ha! I got you, I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.&quot;</p>  <p>The
salesman shook his head, &quot;You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would
press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one
hell of a headache.&quot;</p>
