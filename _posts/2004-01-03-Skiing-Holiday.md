<P>We've just got back from our first family skiing holiday. What a blast!</P>
<P>We went to a small resort called <A class="" href="http://www.passotonale.it/ing/" target=_blank>Passo Tonale</A> high (1880m) up in the Italian Alps and stayed at the excellent 3* <A class="" href="http://www.hotelgardenia.net/" target=_blank>Gardenia Hotel</A>.</P>
<P>During the week we were there the area had over 500mm of great <A class="" href="http://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Passo-Tonale.0to3mid.php" target=_blank>ski snow</A>. Added to that where were some great sunny days which made the skiing just perfect. It was New Years Day whilst we were there and we were treated to great 7 course gala dinner followed by crazy fireworks let off by the locals outside the hotel!</P>
<P>Our two lads, Tom (who turned 14 whilst we were away) and Will (9), took to the snow like natives. Mum was considered a semi-pro and Dad was, well, <FONT size=2>positively </FONT>pedestrian :-) The lads also had an hours snowboarding lession on our last day and declared that they would choose to snowboard for the whole week next time.</P>
