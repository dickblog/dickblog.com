<a href="http://monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml" target="_blank">Combine PDFs</a>
is a freeware Mac OS X application that combines multiple PDFs into a
single file through a simple drag &lsquo;n&rsquo; drop interface (useful for when
needing to collate documents with varying formatting arrangements
(particularly header graphics) into a single document for
distribution).
