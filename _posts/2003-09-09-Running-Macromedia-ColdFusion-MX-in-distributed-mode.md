<P><SPAN class=mmbody>From the <A class="" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/administration/cfmx_in_distributed_mode/" target=_blank>Macromedia DevNet</A>:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=mmbody>"Using Macromedia ColdFusion MX, you can run the application server and web server components on separate computers. The computer hosting the application server (ColdFusion MX) is often called the back-end computer, and the computer hosting the web server is called the front-end computer. This configuration, called distributed mode, is a common method of distributing the processing load across multiple computers. This article provides details on how to set up this configuration. The setup is significantly different than it was in earlier versions of ColdFusion".</SPAN></P>
