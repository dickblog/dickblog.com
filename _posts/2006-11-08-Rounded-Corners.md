I've always like rounded corners in my designs. I've found this <a href="http://www.smileycat.com/miaow/archives/000044.html" target="_blank">extensive list of rounded corner resources</a>.

Here's a new one where you can <a href="http://www.acko.net/files/nifty-aa.html" target="_blank">give the radius of the corner</a>. Also it looks like my fav <a href="http://www.html.it/articoli/niftycube/index.html" target="_blank">Nifty Corners</a> has had an update.
