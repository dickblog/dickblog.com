According to Kay<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Smoljak, &quot;<a href="http://kay.smoljak.com/archives/?search-engine-optimisation-does-matter" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimisation Does Matter</a>&quot;.<br/><br/>Kay makes a good point...<br/><br/>&quot;A link to a site means absolutely nothing - or even less than that - if
the link's anchor text doesn't include the keyword that the site is
