Sandra Clark has started a great series of articles at the Fusion Authority.<br/><br/>Some points of note:<br/><ul><li>For some reason, the XML prolog (&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;) throws Internet Explorer 6 into quirks mode.</li><li>Because the [xHTML] specification requires that a DOCTYPE be the first line of
a page, I tend to place my DOCTYPE in Application.cfm (as the first
line).</li><li>In HTML, there are some attributes which have no value. For example, an
input tag could have &lt;option selected&gt;. In xHTML, this must be
set at &lt;option selected=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;. Just make sure the attribute
name and the value are the same.<br/></li></ul><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/Article.cfm/ArticleID:4424">An Introduction to CSS and Structured Markup, Part I</a><br/>
