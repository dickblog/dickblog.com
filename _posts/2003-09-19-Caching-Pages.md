<P>From Macromedia's website, <A class="" href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/cfcaching.html" target=_blank>this page</A> describes how caching can increase performance...</P>
<P>"ColdFusion allows you to cache data in several ways and is very simple to implement. Using caching features often produces a dramatic positive effect on overall site performance. Given these facts, it is strange the caching strategies are often an under-appreciated and under-used feature of ColdFusion".<!-- InstanceEnd --></P>
