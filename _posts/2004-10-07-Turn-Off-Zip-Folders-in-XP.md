<P>Not that I run Windows XP you understand, but this could be useful one day...</P>
<P>"A minor annoyance with XP is that it expands zip files into folders when you are browsing on Windows Explorer. To turn this off, do the following on the command prompt: </P>
<DIV class=storycontent>
<P>regsvr32 /u zipfldr.dll</P>
<P>To re-enable it, type this on the command prompt: </P>
<P>regsvr32 zipfldr.dll</P>
<P>You should hear a bell and a confirmation after doing these commands. You probably need to be in the Administrator group to do this as well."</P></DIV>
