Not cracked this Subversion thing yet, but <a href="http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2006/04/26/introduction_to_subversion_screencast/" target="_blank">this Introduction to Subversion Screencast screencast might help</a>.

Also there is a <a href="http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/index.cfm?commentID=271" target="_blank">ColdFusion Weekly podcast</a> that talks about it.

They mention a share Subversion service called <a href="https://secure.cvsdude.org/" target="_blank">CVSDude</a> that offers remote Subversion services. Neat!

Succor has some <a href="http://succor.co.uk/index.cfm/2006/7/3/Installing-Subversion-SVN-links" target="_blank">more links</a>.
