<a href="http://snugtech.com/en/safaritest" target="_blank">Safari Screenshot Compatibility Test</a> is yet another way to test your websites in Safari. The nice feature about this service is that the result is returned in only a couple of seconds. The others I have used take up to a couple of minutes.
