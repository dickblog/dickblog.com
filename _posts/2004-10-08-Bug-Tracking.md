<P><A class="" href="http://www.markme.com/cantrell/archives/006094.cfm" target=_blank>Christian Cantrell is asking</A> what bug tracking solutions people are using.</P>
<P>"What kind of bug tracking systems are people using out there? In particular, I'm interested in free, web-based systems. I've used Bugzilla in the past, and GNATS, both of which were decent, though I think I preferred GNATS. What's your favorite, and why?"</P>
