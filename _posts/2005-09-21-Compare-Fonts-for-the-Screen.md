<a href="http://typetester.maratz.com/" target="_blank">Typetester</a> is an web-based
application that allows you to compare how different fonts will display
on a screen. It&rsquo;s primary role is to make web designer&rsquo;s or web
developer&rsquo;s life easier. The author promises that as the new fonts are
bundled into various operating systems, the list of the common fonts
will be updated.
