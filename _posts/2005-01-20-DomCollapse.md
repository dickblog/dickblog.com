This is a nice and clean method of collapsing areas of your page.<br/><br/>&quot;<a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/tools/domcollapse.php" target="_blank">DomCollapse </a>is a Javascript that enables you to have collapsible 
		elements in an HTML	document. The collapsing and expanding of the 
		elements is done via DOM. Non-DOM compatible browsers simply display
		the otherwise collapsed elements. The presentation of the effect is 
		completely style-able in the CSS.&quot;
