<p>
                  <a href="http://titanium.dstc.edu.au/xml/xs3p/" target="_blank"><em>xs3p</em> </a>is a schema documentation generator. 
                    Basically, it is
                    an XSLT 
                    stylesheet that will generate an XHTML document
                    from an XSD 
                    schema. Some of its cool features are:</p>
               <ul><li>It provides links that allow the user to jump to 
                    the documentation of schema components that are 
                    referenced.</li><li>It provides a view of schema components'
                    constraints as a sample XML instance.</li><li>For global type definitions, it shows the
                    super- and sub- types of the type definition.</li><li>For global element declarations, it shows the
                    substitution groups that the element declaration 
                    heads or belongs to.</li><li>It can sort schema components by type and name.</li><li>It has a glossary section which explains some
                    XML Schema terminology.</li></ul>
