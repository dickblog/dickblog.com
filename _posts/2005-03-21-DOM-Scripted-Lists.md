Here is a very cool method for creating <a href="http://www.gazingus.org/html/DOM-Scripted_Lists_Revisited.html" target="_blank">Expandable Lists</a>
using DOM-Scripting. The script simply takes an unordered list and
makes the sublists therein expandable and collapsible. The method uses
semantic markup and the external JavaScript keeps your
standards-compliant code clean.
