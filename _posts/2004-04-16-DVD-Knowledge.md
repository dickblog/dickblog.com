<P>Here's some really good site I've found concerning writing DVD's.</P>
<P><A class="" href="http://www.dvdrhelp.com/" target=_blank>DVDrHelp</A></P>
<P><A class="" href="http://www.dvd-recordable.org/" target=_blank>DVD Recordable Media</A></P>
<P>I've also found some great DVD copying software that I've <A class="" href="http://www.dickblog.com/index.cfm/blog/1334837/">blogged</A>.</P>
<P>Next you need to find some DVD media. I won't try to compare the different brands, I've no idea anyway, so I'll just repeat the opinion of others by recommending Ritek. The best place I've found to buy these disk is <A class="" href="http://www.kvjfairdeal.com/" target=_blank>KVJ Fairdeal</A> on the Whitechapel Road, London.</P>
