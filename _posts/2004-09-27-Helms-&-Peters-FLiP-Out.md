<P>"In August 2004, Hal Helms and I (Jeff Peters) sat down to talk about Fusebox, FLiP, and other methodologies. 3 hours of talking and a bunch of editing later, the 2-CD set "Helms &amp; Peters FLiP Out" came to life. We distributed "Helms &amp; Peters FLiP Out" at the Fusebox 2004 conference. The tracks from this set are provided here in MP3 format for your use though the sponsorship of <A class="" href="http://www.halhelms.com/" target=_blank>Hal Helms, Inc.</A> and <A class="" href="http://www.protonarts.com/" target=_blank>Proton Arts</A>."</P>
